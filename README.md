## Additional Changes

All changes implemented without affecting the function of the webpage:

1. Removed unnecessary elements.

2. Spaced out each section of information using article element as each section on the webpage contained different information.

3. Used aside element to define the content on the sidebar of the webpage as it is separate from the rest of the content on the webpage.

4. Grouped all similar syntax within the CSS Style Sheet in order to minimize coding.

5. Added <nav> element as this will enable the ability for user to jump from one section to another on a webpage.

6. Added comments to indicate what was done.
