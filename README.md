# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Project Horieseon SEO

## Description

This project required Refactoring of a code that was unorganized and unreadable to the human eye. The code itself did work, but it was missing elements to it that organized and limited the amount of coding needed.

    ```


## Noticeable Issues:

1. Overuse of <div> element. Some did not have a closing tag.

2. The information was not indented and spaced out in a comprehensive manner, which made it difficult to follow.

3. Needed to space out elements used for the sidebar content.

4. The CSS Style Sheet could have grouped certain syntax together as they provided the same effects for specific elements, such as the borders, images, style, and size of the font.

5. Images were missing the <alt> tag which is an accessibility standard as it provides a brief descriptor of the image.

6. Missing <nav> element which provides the ability click on a link to jump to a specific location on webpage.

## Resolution:

1. Removed unnecessary <div> elements and closed open tags.

2. Using <article> element worked to space out each section of information. Used article as each section on the webpage contained different information.

3. Used <aside> element to define the content on the sidebar of the webpage as it is separate from the rest of the content on the webpage.

4. Grouped all similar syntax within the CSS Style Sheet in order to minimize coding.

5. Add the <alt> to abide by accessibility standards.

6. Added <nav> element as this will enable the ability for user to jump from one section to another on a webpage.

7. Added comments to indicate what was done.
